### Hello World

I'm Marius, and I studied Computer Science in [Karlsruhe (Germany)](https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de/) and started my software-development-career as a UI developer in sunny California at [SAP Labs](https://twitter.com/sap_bayarea). During this time, I learned to love web technologies like JavaScript and Node.js.

After many *ugly* fights against [CSS](https://giphy.com/gifs/frustrated-annoyed-programming-yYSSBtDgbbRzq), I relocated to Munich, where I now work as a Developer Advocate for SAP BTP and SAP UI technologies. In this new role, I try to inspire my peer developers around the globe to build scalable cloud-native enterprise apps.

Here's a list of my favorite web resources:

- 🏎 Get a [free account on SAP BTP Trial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html)
- 📚 Learn about new SAP technology in the [Developer Center](https://developers.sap.com/)
- 💬 Join the [SAP Community](https://community.sap.com/) to talk about tech
- 🐦 Get in contact with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/IObert_)
- 🔥 To learn about SAP's hot UI technology frameworks (that are Open Source!): [OpenUI5](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/), [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/), and [Fundamental Library Styles](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/)
