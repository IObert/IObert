### Hello World 🦁

My passion is to explore the latest communication technologies and speak about them. Originally from the Black Forest in Germany, I started my software-development career as a UI developer in sunny California. During this time, I learned to love web technologies like JavaScript in general and the entire Node.js ecosystem. 

After many [*ugly fights*](https://giphy.com/gifs/frustrated-annoyed-programming-yYSSBtDgbbRzq) against CSS, I relocated to Munich, working as a Developer Evangelist at Twilio. In this role, I try to inspire my peer developers around the globe to build cloud-native apps with excellent customer engagement.

Besides my day job at Twilio, I'm also interested in web 3.0 technologies.
