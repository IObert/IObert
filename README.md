### Hello World 🦁

My passion is exploring the latest communication technologies – and, even more, sharing my knowledge and learning from others. Originally from the [Black Forest](https://www.twitch.tv/blackforest_wildlife) in Germany, I started my software development career as a UI developer in Silicon Valley, where I discovered my love for web technologies, especially JavaScript and the entire Node.js ecosystem.

After countless creative (and sometimes [*frustrating*](https://giphy.com/gifs/frustrated-annoyed-programming-yYSSBtDgbbRzq)) battles with CSS, I relocated to Munich, where I now work as a Developer Evangelist at Twilio. In this role, I inspire and empower developers around the world to build cloud-native apps with outstanding customer engagement. I’ve also spent nearly a decade working on enterprise frontend development and even wrote a book on the topic.

Whether on stage, in workshops, or through hands-on prototypes, I love exchanging ideas with fellow developers and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. When I’m not doing that, I dive into the world of Web 3.0 – always on the lookout for the next exciting technology.
