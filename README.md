### Hello World ü¶Å

I'm Marius, and I studied Computer Science in [Karlsruhe (Germany)](https://www.karlsruhe.dhbw.de/) and started my software-development-career as a UI developer in sunny California. During this time, I learned to love web technologies like JavaScript and Node.js.

After many *ugly* fights against [CSS](https://giphy.com/gifs/frustrated-annoyed-programming-yYSSBtDgbbRzq), I relocated to Munich, where I now work as a Developer Evangelist at Twilio. In this new role, I try to inspire my peer developers around the globe to connect their cloud-native apps with end-users via suitable communication channels.
