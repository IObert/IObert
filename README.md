### Hello World

I'm Marius, and I started my software-development career as a UI developer in sunny California at [SAP Labs](https://twitter.com/sap_bayarea). After many *ugly* fights against [CSS](https://giphy.com/gifs/frustrated-annoyed-programming-yYSSBtDgbbRzq), I decided to relocate to the beer-capital Munich, where I now work as a Developer Advocate. My focus areas are the SAP Cloud Platform and SAP UI technologies. I try to keep up to speed with cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technologies in general in my spare time.

Here's a list of my favorite web resources:

- 🏎 Get a free [SAP Cloud Platform](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) trial account
- 📚 Learn about new SAP technology in the [Developer Center](https://developers.sap.com/)
- 💬 Join the [SAP Community](https://community.sap.com/) to talk about tech
- 🐦 Get in contact with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/IObert_)
- 🔥 To learn about SAP's hot UI technology frameworks (that are Open Source!): [OpenUI5](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/), [UI5 Web Components](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/), and [Fundamental Library Styles](https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/)
